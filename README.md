## CVE Search Docker

##### General

In the root of this repo there is a docker-compose.yml file that can be used
to build and run the required containers for CVE Search.

You will need to [install docker compose (V2)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
in order to perform this option.

Simply clone the repo, move into the root of the cloned repo and run the command:
~~~
docker compose up 
~~~

The first time the mongodb container is started the database will be populated
from the mongodb dump. This might take a minute or two. During the population
the webinterface might have difficulty establishing connection to the mongodb.
Once done populating the connection should be restored automatically and the  
webserver should function normally.

The cve_search instance should be available under https://localhost

##### Windows specific

open powershell as administrator:
~~~
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all
reboot
~~~

[install](https://desktop.docker.com/win/edge/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe) docker for desktop windows (edge version)

[install](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi) wsl_update_x64.msi

~~~

[install](https://git-scm.com/download/win) git for windows.

~~~
url=https://github.com/cve-search/CVE-Search-Docker.git
dir=$USERPROFILE'\source\repos\'"$(cut -d'/' -f3 <<<$url)"'\'"$(cut -d'/' -f4 <<<$url)"

mkdir -p "$dir" && cd "$dir" && git clone $url && cd "$dir"/CVE-Search-Docker
